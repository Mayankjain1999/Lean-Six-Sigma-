# Project Type: Lean Six Sigma
# Methodology: DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) & Theory of Constraints (TOC)
# 1. Define Phase
In the Define phase, the set out to identify the problem, establish a clear objective and define the scope of the project.

1.1. Problem Statement

The grinding operation for camplates on the machine was experiencing significant inefficiencies due to the extremely short lifespan of the grinding wheels. The existing aluminum oxide wheels could only process an average of 16 parts before needing replacement. This frequent replacement led to:

• High operational costs due to the frequent purchase of new grinding wheels.

• Increased machine downtime, as each wheel change required stopping the production line.

• Production bottlenecks, with the grinding process being a major constraint in the overall workflow.

• Process instability, leading to quality issues such as variations in Rz (surface roughness) and Tpi (twist per inch) parameters.

• Reliability issues with the dressing unit, which used a single-point dresser and a pneumatic actuator.

1.2. Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to increase the lifespan of the grinding wheel from 16 parts to a target of 600-800 parts per wheel.

Secondary objectives included:

• Reducing machine downtime and operational costs.

• Improving the stability and quality of the grinding process.

• Eliminating the bottleneck in the production line by applying the Theory of Constraints.

1.3. Project Scope

The project was focused on the camplate grinding process on the machine. The scope included the evaluation and modification of:

• Grinding wheel material and specifications.

• Dressing process and equipment.

• Actuator system for the dressing unit.

2. Measure Phase

In the Measure phase, collect data to establish a baseline for the process performance and to identify key metrics for improvement.

2.1. Baseline Performance

The initial data collected revealed the following:

Grinding Wheel Lifespan: An average of 16 parts per aluminum oxide wheel.

Quality Parameters:

• Rz: 15 out of 15 parts measured had Rz values that were out of specification.

• Tpi: Most parts had a Tpi value greater than 20%, which was outside the acceptable range.

• Dressing Process: The dressing skip was set to one part, meaning the wheel was dressed after every single part, leading to excessive wheel wear.

• Machine Downtime: The frequent wheel changes contributed to significant downtime, although the exact duration was not quantified in the initial data.

2.2. Data Collection

Data was collected from trial runs, as documented in the " " file. This included measurements of the rough and finish grinding wheels before and after grinding and dressing, allowing the team to quantify the wheel wear during each process.

3. Analyze Phase

In the Analyze phase, Analyzed the collected data to identify the root causes of the problem. The Theory of Constraints (TOC) was used to identify the grinding operation as the primary bottleneck.

3.1. Root Cause Analysis

• The analysis identified the following root causes for the low grinding wheel lifespan and process instability:

• Inappropriate Grinding Wheel Material: The aluminum oxide wheels were not suitable for the application, leading to rapid wear and a short lifespan.

• Inefficient Dressing Process: The use of a single-point dresser and a high-frequency dressing cycle (after every part) contributed to excessive wheel wear.

• Unreliable Dressing Unit: The pneumatic actuator for the dressing unit was not reliable and had repeatability issues, making it difficult to maintain a consistent dressing process. This also made it unfeasible to mount a more efficient rotary dresser.

• Process Instability: The combination of these factors led to an unstable process, resulting in poor quality and out-of-spec parts.

3.2. Identification of Bottleneck

The grinding operation was identified as the main bottleneck in the production line. The frequent downtime for wheel changes and the slow cycle time were constraining the overall output of the system.

4. Improve Phase

In the Improve phase, Implemented a series of changes to address the root causes identified in the analysis.

4.1. Implementation of Solutions

The following improvements were implemented:

Upgrading the Grinding Wheel: The aluminum oxide wheels were replaced with Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) grinding wheels. Several specifications of CBN wheels were tested to find the optimal combination for rough and finish grinding.

Initial Trials: The first set of CBN wheels (Rough: B126-K172-VTR, Finish: B046-K200-VSS) resulted in out-of-spec Rz and Tpi parameters.

Current Trials: A new set of CBN wheels (Rough: B091-K172-VTR, Finish: B046-M200-VSS) was tested, which brought all parameters within specification.

Improving the Dressing Process: The single-point dresser was replaced with a rotary dresser, which is more efficient and provides a more consistent dressing action.

Upgrading the Dressing Unit: The unreliable pneumatic actuator was replaced with a hydraulic slide and actuator. This new system was more reliable and could accommodate both single-point and rotary dressers.

4.2. Results of Improvements

The implemented changes resulted in a dramatic improvement in the grinding process:

Increased Grinding Wheel Lifespan: The lifespan of the grinding wheel increased from 16 parts to 700 parts, a 4,275% improvement. This is a significant step toward the target of 1,500 parts per wheel.

Improved Quality: The Rz and Tpi parameters were brought within specification, and the overall process became more stable.

Reduced Costs and Downtime: The longer lifespan of the grinding wheels led to a significant reduction in operational costs and machine downtime.

5. Control Phase

In the Control phase, the project team established measures to ensure that the improvements are sustained over the long term.

5.1. Standardization and Documentation

The new grinding process, including the specifications for the CBN wheels and the new dressing procedure, has been documented as the new standard operating procedure.

5.2. Training

Operators and maintenance staff have been trained on the new process and equipment to ensure they can operate and maintain the system effectively.

5.3. Future Plans

The following next steps have been planned to continue the improvement journey:

Wheel Life Establishment: Continue the trial to establish the full lifespan of the new CBN wheels, with a target of 1,500 parts per wheel (scheduled for CW 33).

Horizontal Implementation: After the full wheel life is established, the plan is to implement the new process on all other grinding machines in the facility (scheduled for CW 48).

6. Conclusion

This Lean Six Sigma project successfully addressed the inefficiencies in the grinding operation by applying the DMAIC methodology and the Theory of Constraints. By systematically identifying and addressing the root causes of the problem, the project team was able to achieve a remarkable 4,275% increase in the lifespan of the grinding wheel, significantly reducing costs and improving operational efficiency.

The project not only solved the immediate problem but also established a more stable and reliable process that will deliver long-term benefits to the organization.
